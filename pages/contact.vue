        <p class="text-blue-light mb-2">I want to make ColtXP the absolute best that it can be. If you have any feedback or input that you feel will improve the user experience please do not hesitate to send it over! See a bug happening? Send it over! Want to contribute to ColtXP? I am absolutely open to allowing others to help build ColtXP with me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-blue-light">ColtXP started as a small project to learn building in React, but the more I built it the more invested I became in its core mission. I am not an expert React developer and in fact, this is my first React app, so please keep this in mind when sending any feedback, suggestions, or comments.
